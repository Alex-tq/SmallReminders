      <h3>Welcome To Small Reminders!</h3>
      <p>
      You may be familiar with Ray Dalio's famous concept of principles - lessons you learn in life, and keep with you to influence your future decisions.
      The challenge that our media-rich culture presents is the fact that we may discover such a lesson, and forget it after a few days.
      Despite having written it down in your notes, maybe even hung it up on your wall, it eventually fades into the background and you forget.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to use this app as memorable repository, as well as a tool to send yourself reminders.
